        Indiepen staff explicitly reserves for itself curatorial, not editorial power.  This means that we go out of our way to not make any decisions about what content should or should not be allowed on the site.  However, sometimes legal restrictions force us to reject a proposal.  In such an event we will work with you to create a proposal that we can allow on the site.
